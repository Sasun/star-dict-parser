star-dict-parser
================

This is a Java library project for parsing StarDict dictionary files, refer <a href="https://code.google.com/p/babiloo/wiki/StarDict_format">https://code.google.com/p/babiloo/wiki/StarDict_format</a> for more information about the StarDict file format.

Although the StarDict format is rather solid and concise, but utilizing it in your own applications might not
be a trivial task. Star-dict-parser can relieve you from some programming and debugging burden.

It is expected to run smoothly on Java platforms, including Java SE, Android, etc.
